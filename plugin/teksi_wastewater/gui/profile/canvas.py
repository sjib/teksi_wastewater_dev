        Schematic pixel extents of each structure around its anchor level, as

        The shafts/covers are drawn in exaggerated pixel space around the pipe
        invert, which zoomFull knows nothing about — the widget uses these
        extents to widen the initial zoom margins so the topmost manhole's
        cover isn't clamped against the plot edge.

        These follow the anchor/offset cases of paint() but deliberately do
        NOT reproduce them — do not "sync" the two. This answers "how much
        elevation headroom must the initial view reserve", whose honest answer
        is the SCHEMATIC height, MANHOLE_MAX_SHAFT_PX cap included, because
        that cap *is* the decision that deep shafts are drawn 70px tall rather
        than to scale. paint() additionally raises the wall of a deep drop
        shaft to its true cover (min(top_y_exag, cover_true_pt.y())), which
        answers a different question: how far the wall must reach for the
        inflow pipe to land on it instead of dangling in mid-air.

        Reporting that true height here would make _applyPaddedZoomFull
        reserve the whole real depth — 56.3 m for structure 10.098, a vortex
        manhole — and since the padded range also decides the auto-snapped
        vertical exaggeration, a single deep shaft would flatten a short path
        into a horizontal line at a low exaggeration, destroying the point of
        a length profile. paint() overshooting the reserved headroom is
        clamped to the plot edge instead, which is why very deep structures
        are intentionally not depth-comparable by eye.
